# Web-Socket
As part of my Enterprise Distributed Systems course, I implemented a simple client-server application to run a simple messaging system using Web Sockets.

There are two modes of running this.
1. Client application: The client application generates and sends 10K requests to the server and receives a response appending a randomly generated number at the end of the message sent.
2. Client website: The HTML webpage sends a single request to the server and receives a randomly generated number.

For a detailed summary, refer the Web Socket Assignment Report attached.
